onlineKmeans.py
===============
*For obtanining cluster center, we need to call onlineKmeans function and we need to pass data and initial number of cluster as parameter
*For obtaining feature extraction, we need to call onlineKmeansFeature where we need to pass obtained cluster center and data as parameter

DATASET
=======
*In this folder we have our dataset of breast cncer and lung cancer

offlineKMeansBreastCancer.py
============================
*This one will calculate offline K-means cost for breast cancer

offlineKMeansLungCancer.py
============================
*This one will calculate offline K-means cost for lung cancer

mainBreastCancer.py
===================
*By running this file we will get classification and clustering result with online k-means feature for breast cancer


mainLungCancer.py
===================
*By running this file we will get classification and clustering result with online k-means feature for lung cancer

ClassificationWithAllFeaturesBreastCancer.py
============================================
*By running this file we will get classification consiering all the raw features for breast cancer


ClassificationWithAllFeaturesLungCancer.py
============================================
*By running this file we will get classification consiering all the raw features for lung cancer
